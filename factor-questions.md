Questions:
- how to build and apply a page-template override to test the <commentizer> component in the example app
- documentation on dashboard components (<dashboard-input> checked state)
- how to update instead of save post

Comment save format options:
- comments as individual posts, populated/projected into parent commentizer posts
  + managed by factor

- comments as object in commentizer post data
  + managed by plugin
